# Research

The Healthcare Access and Innovation Laboratory (HAIL) is conceptualized to apply epidemiologic and systems engineering approaches to understanding the current status of neurologic disease care in India and develop scalable, low-cost, and digital solutions that facilitate the delivery of timely and appropriate care for patients suffering from these diseases. The efforts of this laboratory will target the following disease processes across all age groups, all of which are significant sources of morbidity and disability in India:

1. Epilepsy
2. Stroke
3. Headache
4. Dementia
5. CNS Neoplasm
6. Traumatic Brain Injury

HAIL and its projected outcomes are intended to serve as a laboratory model for using Epidemiology, Biostatistics, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence tools to provide healthcare screening and access for other diseases across the national landscape and for launching other healthcare access programs in India.
